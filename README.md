# tetris-ai

## Introduction
Tetris looked like the perfect game to test a powerfull machine learning ai. The goal of this project is to test the vaibility of machine learning in a realy basic tertis game.
The project will consist of 3 main parts: making the tetris game, researching how en what kind of machine learning to use, implementing the machine learning into the game.

# The making of my tetris
First thing on the todo list is decide to use a game enige or to make it completely from scratch. I decided that using unity is the best option because bevause of the ease of use and I can finish the game way faster in unity.
